Lab2 requires the use of `System Verilog` to implement **a single cycle 32-bit MIPS architecture CPU**.

This lab does not use the source code framework provided by the course resources, but it can also achieve the required functions.

Both instruction memory and data memory use Xilinx's Block RAM IP core.
